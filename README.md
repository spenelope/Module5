# Overview

TicTacToe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares.

The main objective of this project is to apply my knowledge of C#. C# is widely used for developing desktop applications, web applications and web services.
